# WeakAuras

Collection of WeakAuras for use with the 3.3.5 version of [WeakAuras](https://github.com/Bunny67/WeakAuras-WotLK)

# Multiple Specs

Specs are difficult to track in this version of WeakAuras, if you want to use multiple WeakAuras for the same class, I recommend using the "Never" tickbox under "Load" to unload WeakAuras not currently in use.

# To-Do

Update the following to work with new WA version.
- Demo
- Destro

Remove the section for multiple specs, as new WA version has (limited) spec tracking. (after adding demo/destroy specs)
